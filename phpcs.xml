# Alda Vigdis' PHPCS Configuration for WordPress Plugins

A PHPCS Configuration for WordPress plugins, assuming the use of PSR-4
autoloading and Imposter.

The mainline WordPress coding standard is meant for use with WordPress itself
and projects that may end up being included in the WordPress Core. When making
your own plugins or themes using modern development methods and practices that
reflect that you know what you're doing, the best course of action is to shake
off some of the legacy constraints that the WP Core has allowed to remain since
2005, while allowing for some of the performance, security and stylistic rules
to remain in your own work.

This ruleset assumes the following:

- The presence of the slevomat, wp-coding-standards and phpcompatibility packages
- PSR-4 autoloading and namespacing using Composer and tools such as Imposter
- Tabs for indentation, as per WP itself
- Yoda conditions were never a good idea
- Applies WP-derrived rules to JS and CSS files
- JS and CSS to be enqueued inside of <head>

Further reading and tools:

- The PSR-4 autoloading standard: https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/
- The PSR-4 autoloading section of the PHP Composer manual: https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md#autoloading
- The Imposter plugin for PHP Composer: https://github.com/typisttech/imposter-plugin
